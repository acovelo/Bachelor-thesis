After using the task xyxymatch in IRAF, we obtain a file (let us name it "results.dat") containing 6 columns: X reference coordinate, Y reference coordinate, X input coordinate, Y input coordinate, Reference line number and Input line number.

In this repository, you can find three files which allows you to obtain the sky coordinates of each star, the color-magnitude diagram and the tip of the Red Giant Branch.
